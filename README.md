# Certigen: Blockchain-Based Certificate Generation and Distribution

Certigen is a web application built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows for the seamless generation, distribution, and verification of certificates in the form of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). This project aims to simplify the process of issuing and verifying student documents like transcripts, marksheets, degrees, and certificates.

## Introduction

Certigen leverages the Ethereum blockchain and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) to ensure the security, immutability, and easy verification of certificates. By converting certificates into NFTs and linking them to blockchain transactions, Certigen provides a transparent and tamper-proof solution for certificate management.
